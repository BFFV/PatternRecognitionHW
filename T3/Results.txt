***Implementation Details & Results***

Features:

* LBP: Local Binary Patterns, concatenation of all 4 variants (default, rotational invariant, uniform, nri_uniform).
* HoG: Histogram of Gradients with 16 orientations and 1 cell (the entire image).
* Haralick: Haralick Textures, using distance=1.
* Gabor: Gabor Features, considering 8 rotations and 8 dilations.

Selection:

* MI_n: Mutual Information, keep 'n' best scored features considering n_neighbors=3.
* SFS_n: Sequential Forward Selection, obtain 'n' best features with fisher score.

Transformation:

* PCA_n: Principal Component Analysis, obtain 'n' principal components.

Classifiers:

* SVM: Support Vector Machine, using C=1 and kernel='rbf'.
* NN: Neural Network (Multi Layer Perceptron), using 2 hidden layers of size 50 each, 
activation function 'relu', max amount of iterations at 2000 and random_state=1 (for consistent testing).
* RandomForest: Random Forest, using 1000 estimators, entropy criterion, unlimited max_depth and 
random_state=1 (for consistent testing).
